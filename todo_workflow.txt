# Capital Workflow Engine 

1. Visual Drag and Drop Designer: Intuitive canvas for building workflow maps without coding 
2. workflow versioning: managing multiple versions of a workflow with rollback capabilities 
3. Template Library: Pre-built templates for common products used in banking, financial industry. (Term Loan, LOC, MCA)
4. Conditional Logic Gates: "If/Then/Else" codes based on data attributes 
5. Parallel Execution Paths: Enable simultaneous process of credit pulls and KYC Checks 
6. Looping Constructs: Support for Iterative trasks (e.g., collecting signatures from 5 guarantors)
7. Sub-workflow integration: Embed reusable sub-process into master flows 
8. SLA Timer Nodes: Configure deadlines for specific stages - example mentioned was underwriting must complete in 24 hours 
9. Dynamic form builder: integrated UI to design the data captutre forms for each stage 
10. Node Annotations: Allow architect to leave comments/ notes on specific steps for clairty 
11. Import/Export Workflows: JSON-based export for backup, YAML based export  for backup or cross-environment migration 
12. Simulation Mode: Test Workflow logic with dummy data before going live. test automation, test data autoamtion
13. Role-based Task Assignemnts : Assign specific nodes to roles 
14. User Restriction Policies: Lock workflows from editing once published to production
15. Auto-Save Draft: Prevent loss of work during design sessions 
16. Compliance locking: lock specifc nodes from modification by non-compliance users. limit this to Audit teams
(I need to revisit and automate all the regulatory specific automations using agents. This will eliminate any foul play, digital forensics, direct reporting to governance with flags and blockchain logs)
17.Workflow cloning: Duplicate existing workflows to create variations quickly 
18. Visual Sphaghetti Detection: Warning for overly complex flows that degrade performance 
19. Automate all BPMN processes generation, documentation using Excel/CSV, JSON, YAML formats 
20. Custom CSS/UI injection: ability to brandd the workflow forms per franchise partner 
21. Automated Generation of Documentation and Software Architectures 

Orchestration & Execution Engine 
Event-Driven Triggers: Initiate workflows via API, Webhook or FMOS Event. Similar to how safe FME or Pentaho does it 
Saga Orchestrator: Central coordinator for distributed transactions 
Complensating Transaction manger: Execute "undo" logic if a step fails ( release hold funds) 
State Persistence: Save Workflow state to database at every step for resume capability 
Message Queue Integration: lets introduce RabbitMQ/Kafka integration for asynchronous task hanlding, cron job based tasks 
Idempotency Keys: Prevent duplicate worklow triggers from network retries 
Correlation ID tracking: trace a single request across all microservice 
Retry Policies: Configurable exponential backoff for failed service calls. 
Circuit Breeakers: Stop cascading failures if a downstream service is down 
Priority Execution: high priority flaf for instanct execution queies 
Scheduled Delays: Wait states for time-bound processes - three day rescission period 
variable scoping: query and transform data paylods on the fly.
Transaction Isolation: Ensure data integrity during concurrent workflow runs 
Dead letter Queuee(DLQ) Management: Catch-all for unrecoverable errors 
Event Sourcing Log: Reconstruct workflow state by replaying event history 
Throttling controls: limit workflow execution rate to protect downstreeam cores 
Batch Processing Mode: Process bulk workflows (portfolio-=wide rate changes)
Memory Optimization : Efficient hanlding of large data paylods in variables
